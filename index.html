  <h1>Star Wars</h1>

    <h1 class="h1-box">Ben Solo - Kylo Ren</h1>
    <p>Ben Solo was a Force-sensitive human male who, after falling to the dark side of the Force, eventually renounced
      his adopted persona of Kylo Ren and was redeemed. The master of the Knights of Ren, he conquered much of the
      galaxy during his reign as Supreme Leader of the First Order. The Force was strong with Ren; in addition to his
      Jedi training and knowledge of arcane dark side lore, the bloodline of the most powerful Jedi and Sith flowed
      through his veins. He was the embodiement of conflict due to his immersion in both sides' teachings, but it was
      through discord that he derived power, channeling anger into strength. Ultimately Ren was determined to extinguish
      the light side within himself and destroy the last traces of the Jedi Order, fulfilling the legacy of his
      grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader.</p>

    <p>The man who became known as the "Jedi Killer" was born on the planet Chandrila in 5 ABY, when the Galactic Empire
      surrendered to the New Republic. The son of General Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, Ben Solo was trained by his
      uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. After the new Jedi's destruction, Solo renounced his family and assumed the
      identity of Kylo Ren, becoming a First Order warlord and the apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke. Ren's descent
      into darkness was marked by the massacre of civilians and the murder of his father, but the act of patricide
      failed to end his inner turmoil. Believing he was destined to rule the galaxy, Ren assassinated Snoke and usurped
      the position of Supreme Leader, seizing both military and political control of the First Order. It was not a
      complete victory for him, however, as Rey, a Jedi apprentice who he was growing close to, rejected his offer to
      rule beside him.</p>
    <p>During the First Orderâ€“Resistance war, Supreme Leader Ren hunted the remnants of his mother's resistance movement
      and fought another lightsaber duel with Rey on the world of Batuu. Though they were sworn enemies, Ren and Rey
      were a prophesied dyad in the Force, and therefore bound together through a unique bond. Their conflict came to a
      head in 35 ABY with the return of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who urged Ren to kill Rey and become the new
      Emperor. However, his compassion for Rey and the sacrifice of his parents ultimately killed his dark persona.
      After the battle on Exegol, a redeemed Ben Solo gave his life to revive Rey, allowing the two to share a kiss
      before his death as the last of the Skywalker bloodline.
